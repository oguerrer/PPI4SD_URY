"""Policy Priority Inference for Sustainable Development - Estimation & Calibration Code

    and with the support of the National Laboratory for Public Policies (Mexico City),

    and The Alan Turing Institute (London).

This file contains all the necesary functions to estimate the growth factors
of the model and to calibrate the number of periods for convergence. The accompanying 
data can be obtained from the public repository: https://github.com/oguerrer/PPI4SD. 
The two main functions are:
    
    calibrate: finds the optimal number of periods for convergence in terms of 
                matching the total volatility of the indicators' changes
    estimation: given the number of periods for convergence, this function
                estimates the growth factors of the model

There are additional support functions that are explained below.


Example
-------
To run PPI in a Python script, just add the following line:

    steps, alphas = estimation(I0, T, A, R, phi, tau, vola_emp, steps, initial_alphas)
    
This returns the growth factors in the vector 'alphas'.

            is straightforward and the instructions can be found in its
