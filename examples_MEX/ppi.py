"""Policy Priority Inference for Sustainable Development

Acknowledgments: This product was developed through the sponsorship of the
    United Nations Development Programme (bureau for Latin America) 
    and with the support of the National Laboratory for Public Policies (Mexico City), 
    the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica (CIDE, Mexico City), 
    and The Alan Turing Institute (London).

This file contains all the necessary functions to reproduce the analysis presented
in the methodological and technical reports. The accompanying data can be 
obtained from the public repository: https://github.com/oguerrer/PPI4SD. 
There are two functions in this script:
    
    run_ppi : the main function that simulates the policymaking process and
    generates synthetic development-indicator data.
    get_targets : a support function to transform a collection of series 
    where one or more targets are less or equals to the initial value of the series.

Further information can be found in each function's code.


Example
-------
To run PPI in a Python script, just add the following line:

    tsI, tsC, tsF, tsP, tsD, tsS, ticks, H = run_ppi(I0, T)
    
This will simulate the policymaking process for initial values I0 and targets T.
This example assumes no network of spillovers. All other arguments can be
passed as explained in the function run_ppi.

    """Function to run one simulation of the Policy Priority Inference model.

    Parameters
    ----------
        I0: numpy array 
            Initial values of the development indicators.
        T: numpy array 
            Target values for development indicators. These values represent 
            the government's goals or aspirations. For a retrospective analysis, 
            it is usually assumed that the targets correspond to the final values 
            of the series. They should be higher than I0 or the model will not 
            converge.
        A:  2D numpy array
            The adjacency matrix of the spillover network of development 
            indicators. If not given, the model assumes a zero-matrix, so there 
            are no spillovers.
        alpha: float, optional
            A vector of growth factors in (0,1).
        phi: float, optional
            Scalar in [0,1] or numpy array (a vector) with values in [0,1] that 
            represent the quality of the government's monitoring mechanisms.
        tau: float, optional 
            Scalar in [0,1] or numpy array (a vector) with values in [0,1] that 
            represent the quality of the rule of law.
        R: numpy array, optional
            Binary vector indicating which nodes are instrumental (value 1) and 
            which are not (value 0). If not provided, it is assumed that all
            nodes are instrumental (a vector of ones).
        gov_func: python function, optional
            A custom function that that returns the policy priority of the government
        P0: numpy array, optional
            An array with the initial allocation profile.
        H0: numpy array, optional
            The initial vector of historical inefficiencies
        PF: numpy array, optional
            An exogenous vector of policy priorities.
        pf: float, optional
            The probability with which the exogenous priorities are followed
            each period. It must be in [0,1].
        RD: numpy array, optional
            A vector indicating the level of fiscal rigidity of each instrumental
            indicator. RD should be provided together with PF, and each element 
            of RD should be at most as big as the corresponding element in PF.
        tolerance: float, optional
            The precision to consider that an indicator has reached its goal.
            Unless you understand very well how PPI works, this should not be
            changed.
