# Scripts

This folder contains the necessary code to run the version of PPI that was employed for the first report.
The code is written in the Python programming language version 3.
The files are:

* `model_final.py`: Contains all function that runs a simulation of PPI, given the necessary data and parameters. The code is internally documented.
* `model_calibration.py`: Contains the algorithm to estimate the growth factors.

The files require specific Python libraries in order to run.
Those libraries are:

* `numpy`: A popular library for numerical computing.
* `scipy`: A popular library for statistical analysis.
* `joblib`: A library for parallel computing.

In addition, we recommend installing the library `matplotlib` in order to generate visualizations similar to the ones presented in the report.
We suggest installing the *[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)* distribution of Python as it contains all the necessary libraries.
